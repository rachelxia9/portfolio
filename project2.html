            <ul class="skills"> background -
                <li> This project was made for UBC's girlCode hackathon, where we had 24 hours to come up with a product that can be used to forward the fashion-tech industry 
                    that addressed the case problem through the lens of Aritzia. Other members of my team included other UBC students. This product was awarded Best Beginner Hack and Most Creative Hack.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <ul class="skills"> problem -
                <li>We were presented with the following case problem:
                    <strong>How can we use technology to personalize fashion-retail while enhancing the e-commerce experience?</strong>
                </li>
                <li>We identified that online shopping can often be a difficult experience for people with disabilities. Due to time constraints, we specifically focused on wheelchair users
                    and their difficulties with easily finding fashionable, wheelchair-friendly clothing. Additionally, the lack of personalization in e-commerce 
                    can make the experience frustrating compared to shopping in stores where you can interact with style advisors.
